# triathalon-tracker
First application that both tracks workouts for training purposes as well as live stats of the triathalon

Key Functionality I want included:

- Ability to create a group of atheletes who you want to track workouts and triathalon speeds with
- Ability to see each others workouts broken down by the workout types (Running, Biking, etc.) both by average pace and by last workout
- Ability to comment and like other peoples workouts
- Ability to upload photos connected to each workout
- Ability to link the gear you are wearing
